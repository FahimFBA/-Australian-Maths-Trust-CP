The problems in this set are designed to be more accessible to beginning coders. As a learning aid, walkthroughs discussing how to solve the problems in this set are available by clicking on this link. On completion of this problem set, students should know how to use a programming language to read and write files, perform simple arithmetic calculations, and write conditional (if) statements.

# Addition
Input File: addin.txt
Output File: addout.txt
Time Limit: 1 second

Your task here is a straight-forward one: you are to write a program that takes two numbers and adds them together. Luckily, computers are built for adding numbers together and will do all the calculation for you - all you need to do is write code that will correctly read from and write to the text files.

# Input
The input file will consist of the two integers a and b separated by a single space. It is guaranteed that 0 <= a, b <= 1,000,000,000.

# Output
Your output file should consist of a single integer, the sum of a and b.

# Sample Input
```
23 45
```
# Sample Output
```
68
```
# Scoring
The score for each input file will be 100% if the correct answer is written to the output file and 0% otherwise.
